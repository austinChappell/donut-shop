# The Donut House

## Project Details

This is a website made for a local donut shop in Red Oak, Texas. The deployed version can be found at www.eatmydonut.com.

### Things to know

This is mostly a single page website. The data, though there is a lot, is hard-coded, as it will not change often. Most recently, a Google Maps embed was added to the footer of the website. Upon clicking the different sections in the menu, the window scrolls to that section.

The order form is submitted via email using PHP. 

The photo gallery is loaded but hidden on the index.html page, so the images are cached for a faster page load when going to the birthday page.
